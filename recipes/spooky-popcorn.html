            <h4 class="h4">Ingredients</h4>
            <ul class="p1">
                <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>75g popping corn</li>
                <li>200g white chocolate</li>
                <li>2 tsp green food colouring</li>
                <li>70g white chocolate buttons</li>
                <li>1 tube black or dark chocolate writing icing</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h4 class="h4">Steps</h4>
            <ol class="p1">
                <li>Line a baking tray with baking paper and set aside. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the popping corn and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Leave for 5 mins, shaking the pan a few times to prevent it from burning on the bottom, until all the corn is popped. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl with the green food colouring. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and has turned an even green colour.</li>
                <li>Pour the melted chocolate over the popcorn in the pan and toss well to coat. Tip the slime-covered popcorn out onto the lined baking tray and spread out in an even layer. Leave for 45 mins ­– 1 hr for the chocolate to set.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, to make the eyes, lay the chocolate buttons flat on a plate or tray and add a dot of writing icing on top of each one. Leave to set until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>To serve, transfer the set popcorn to serving bowls and top with the chocolate eyes.</li>
