            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive or rapeseed oil</li>
                <li>2 large onions finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 large carrots peeled and finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 kg lean lamb mince (or leftover roast lamb)</li>
                <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>800 ml lamb or beef stock - from cubes is fine (I use 2 Kallo organic beef stock cubes)</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the olive oil in a wide, deep saucepan and add the chopped onion, carrots and celery. Cook with the lid on over a gentle heat for about 5 minutes, until softened but not coloured.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat up to medium/high and add the mince. Fry for 5-10 minutes until the mince has browned all over and is flecked with darker brown. (If using leftovers, simply add in the leftovers and skip the rest of this step.</li>
                <li>Tip in the chopped tomatoes, stock and bay leaves, plus salt and pepper to taste. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down low and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
